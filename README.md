# CSID Spatiotemporal Modelling Workshop – Preparatory Work

This repository documents my completion of the virtual preparatory assignments
for the CSID / DHIS2 Spatiotemporal Modelling Workshop (Kigali, Feb 2026).

The purpose of this repository is to provide lightweight, verifiable evidence
of environment setup, version control proficiency, and readiness for hands-on
modelling work during the in-person workshop.

## Completed Assignments
- Terminal basics
- Git and GitHub exercises
- Installation of packages and use of virtual environments (Python)
- Building and running model through CHAP

Detailed notes and verification are provided in `docs/preparation_log.md`
